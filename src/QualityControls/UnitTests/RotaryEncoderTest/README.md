# Unit test: Rotary Encoder input

## Purpouse and summary

To test correct identification of rotary encoder events: clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation. Two consecutive events must happen for each detent with a mostly unnoticeable delay between them: STATE = 1, then STATE = 0. This is equivalent to a short button press and release.

## Harware setup

Actual GPIO numbers are defined at [debugUtils.h](./debugUtils.h).

Relative rotary encoders (choose one of them, or both):
- KY-040 type (with external pull up resistors). `CLK` pin attached to `TEST_ROTARY_CLK`. `DT` pin attached to `TEST_ROTARY_DT`. `V+` and `GND` pins as usual.
- ALPS RKJX series (no external pull up resistors). `A` pin attached to `TEST_ROTARY_ALT_A`, `B` pin attached to `TEST_ROTARY_ALT_DT`. `ENCODER COM` pin attached to `GND`.

Note that this procedure works the same for both rotary encoders. Test one first, then the other.

Output through USB serial port at 115200 bauds.


## Procedure and expected output

1. Reset. Ignore output from the operating system itself. 
2. Output must match:
   
   ```
   -- READY --
   -- GO --
   ```
3. Rotate encoder clockwise (once). Output should be:
   
   ```
   MASK  : 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111110011111

   ```
4. Check the correct position of every bit.
5. Rotate encoder counter-clockwise (once). Output should be:
   
   ```
   MASK  : 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111110011111

   ```
6. Check the correct position of every bit. Note that output from (4) is not the same as output from (1). There is a bit displacement to the left.
7. Rotate encoder randomly many times both fast and slow. Check there is output on every single detent.
8. Rotate encoder randomly many times at slow pace. Check that output is six and only six lines long with each detent.
