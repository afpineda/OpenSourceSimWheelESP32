# Some thoughts from the author

Looking at the content and extension of this project you may think I am a young *do-it-yourself* enthusiast
with strong motivation on building my own steering wheel for sim-racing.

Well... you are wrong.

Nor I'am young nor I want a custom-made steering wheel.

What? So, what is the point of this project?

## Genesis

At some point in a conversation with my fellow sim-racing partners, the question about purchasing a new steering wheel arose.
No doubt most steering wheels in the market are high quality (this sentence does not include you, Fanatec), but the prices,
starting at 550 euros ($ 600, more or less) are too high for the average sim racer in Europe.

Believe it or not, I started this project to demonstrate whether those prices are justified or not (more on this later).

As a software engineer I already had some skills on digital circuits, but had no previous experience in Arduino,
nor in open hardware, nor in *do-it-yourself* projects.
Zero. None.

## Motivation

Despite such a senseless starting point, I found strong personal motivation to work hard on it, but has nothing to do with sim-racing:

- I'm committed to my profession enough as to lead by example:
  - I wanted to demonstrate that test-driven development works,
    even if you don't have a popular testing framework,
    even if your are not able to automate your test,
    even if hardware is involved,
    even if you don't have professional tools.
  - I wanted to demonstrate how transcendent good software documentation is.
  - I wanted to demonstrate that high-quality software takes **less** effort than shoddy work.
- I wanted to leverage my knowledge about GIT, configuration management and the GitHub platform.
- Arduino has been around in chit-chat talks since many years ago.
  It was time to learn something about it.
- It's nice to have a new hobby.
