Other parts (quantity unknown):

- Thin wire.
- Wire with Dupond terminals (for external wiring). A kit for protoboards will do the job. Â¿Male or female? the opposite to pin headers.
- Welding tin.

Other notes:

- The GX16 connector may be replaced by any other kind. The GX16 features a knot that prevents accidental unplug. The 5 pins flavor allows to build a fully capable USB port, not just a charging port, if you want.

## Circuit layout

Open the [circuit layout](./setup3.diy) using [DIY Layout Creator](https://github.com/bancika/diy-layout-creator).

![Setup #3 circuit layout](./setup3.png)

This layout includes the following subsystems (read for an in-depth explanation):

- [Power](../../subsystems/Power/Power_en.md) through a powerboost module already built in the DevKit board.
- [Battery monitor](../../subsystems/BatteryMonitor/BatteryMonitor_en.md) through a built in voltage divider.
- [Switches](../../subsystems/Switches/Switches_en.md).
- [Relative rotary encoder](../../subsystems/RelativeRotaryEncoder/RelativeRotaryEncoder_en.md) bare bone type.
- [Analog clutch paddles](../../subsystems/AnalogClutchPaddles/AnalogClutchPaddles_en.md).

Notes and build tips:

- Some components may look very small, not matching their actual size. This is not a mistake. They must be placed in vertical position, so they lie in a minimal surface of the perfboard.
- There is a lot of wiring, which is prone to human error. Check wiring and traces twice before soldering.

### External wiring

- Each input has an assigned number in the circuit layout. Certain inputs have a particular function, so attach them properly.
- The `POTn_GND` and `POTn_VCC` terminals of each potentiometer are interchangeable. If the clutch (or axis) goes to 100% when idle, swap those terminals.
- Note that the pin headers on the left and right clutch paddles are symmetrical, not identical.
- `Battery(+)` is the positive pole of the battery.
- `Battery(-)` is the negative pole of the battery.
- Attach `Battery(+)` and `Battery(-)` properly. **Take care not to swap those terminals**.
- Bare bone rotary encoders: their built-in push button must be wired to the button matrix just like any other push button, being `SW` and `SW GND` the involved terminals.
- Battery charge port:
  - Cut the USB cable near the Micro-USB/USB-C end, but leave enough length to reach the GX16 plug.
  - Make sure matching GX16 pins in both male and female connectors are soldered to the same wire (same color).
  - Red and black wires are mandatory. Others are optional.

## Firmware upload

**You should calibrate your battery first**. See the [Battery calibration procedure](../../../../src/Firmware/BatteryTools/BatteryCalibration/README.md).

1. Plug the USB cable to the Devkit board and upload the [sketch](../../../../src/Firmware/Setup3/Setup3.ino) with Arduino IDE.
2. Open the serial monitor (Arduino IDE).
3. Reset.
4. Check there are no error messages.
