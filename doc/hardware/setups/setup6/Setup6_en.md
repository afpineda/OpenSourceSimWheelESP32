Other parts (quantity unknown):

- Thin wire.
- Wire with Dupond terminals (for external wiring). A kit for protoboards will do the job. Â¿Male or female? the opposite to pin headers.
- Welding tin.

Additional notes:

- Chose an appropriate male/female power connector depending on your wheel base. Make sure to identify the positive and negative terminals correctly. If you have a *Simagic QR*, negative is the yellow wire and positive is the green one.
- Optional funky switch: ALPS RKJ series, 7-way.

## Circuit layout

Open the [circuit layout](./setup6.diy) using [DIY Layout Creator](https://github.com/bancika/diy-layout-creator).

![Setup #6 circuit layout](./setup6.png)

This layout includes the following subsystems (read for an in-depth explanation):

- [Analog clutch paddles](../../subsystems/AnalogClutchPaddles/AnalogClutchPaddles_en.md).
- [Battery monitor](../../subsystems/BatteryMonitor/BatteryMonitor_en.md).
- [Power](../../subsystems/Power/Power_en.md) through an external power source or batteries.
- [Switches](../../subsystems/Switches/Switches_en.md) through analog multiplexers.
- [Relative rotary encoder](../../subsystems/RelativeRotaryEncoder/RelativeRotaryEncoder_en.md).

Notes and build tips:

- Some components may look very small, not matching their actual size. This is not a mistake. They must be placed in vertical position, so they lie in a minimal surface of the perfboard. All resistors and diodes should fit in 1x4 holes when they lay in horizontal position.
- There is a lot of wiring, which is prone to human error. Check wiring and traces twice before soldering.

### External wiring

- Each input has an assigned number in the circuit layout. Certain inputs have a particular function, so attach them properly.
- The `POTn_GND` and `POTn_VCC` terminals of each potentiometer are interchangeable. If the clutch (or axis) goes to 100% when idle, swap those terminals.
- Note that the pin headers on the left and right clutch paddles are symmetrical, not identical.
- Optional funky switch:
  - The involved terminals are:
    - For rotation: `ENCODER_A`, `ENCODER_B` and `ENCODER_COM`.
    - For push buttons: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `PUSH` and `COM`.
  - Do not confuse `COM` with `ENCODER_COM` since `COM` is physically closer to `ENCODER_A/B` than `ENCODER_COM`.
- Bare bone rotary encoders:
  - The involved terminals are:
    - For rotation: `A` or `CLK` attached to `ROTn_A`, `B` or `DT` attached to `ROTn_B`, `COM` attached to `ROTn_COM`.
    - The built-in push button must be wired to the button matrix just like any other push button, being `SW` and `SW GND` the involved terminals. `SW` attached to the upper row of pin headers, `SW COM` attached to the lower row of pin headers.
  - Do not confuse `COM` and `SW COM`.
  - `ROT1` is mandatory. The others are optional.

**Under no circumstances should you plug an USB cable and an external power source at the same time**. You could damage the DevKit board.

## Firmware upload

At Arduino IDE, configure the board manager as this:

- Board: "WEMOS LOLIN32 Lite"
1. Detach the DevKit board from the circuit before continuing.
2. Plug the USB cable to the Devkit board and upload the [sketch](../../../../src/Firmware/Setup1/Setup1.ino) with Arduino IDE.
3. Attach the DevKit board to the circuit. Keep the USB cable plugged in.
4. Open the serial monitor (Arduino IDE).
5. Reset.
6. Check there are no error messages.
