Other parts (quantity unknown):

- Thin wire.
- Wire with Dupond terminals (for external wiring). A kit for protoboards will do the job. Â¿Male or female? the opposite to pin headers.
- Welding tin.

Other notes:

- The GX16 connector may be replaced by any other kind. The GX16 features a knot that prevents accidental unplug. The 5 pins flavor allows to build a fully capable USB port, not just a charging port, if you want.

## Circuit layout

Open the [circuit layout](./setup4.diy) using [DIY Layout Creator](https://github.com/bancika/diy-layout-creator).

![Setup #3 circuit layout](./setup4.png)

This layout includes the following subsystems (read for an in-depth explanation):

- [Power](../../subsystems/Power/Power_en.md) through a powerboost module already built in the DevKit board or an external power source.
- [Battery monitor](../../subsystems/BatteryMonitor/BatteryMonitor_en.md) through a built in voltage divider.
- [Switches](../../subsystems/Switches/Switches_en.md) through analog multiplexers.
- [Relative rotary encoder](../../subsystems/RelativeRotaryEncoder/RelativeRotaryEncoder_en.md) bare bone type.
- [Analog clutch paddles](../../subsystems/AnalogClutchPaddles/AnalogClutchPaddles_en.md).

Notes and build tips:

- The packaging of the analog multiplexers will show a small circle next to pin #1, which is tagged as `A4` here.

### External wiring

- Each input has an assigned number in the circuit layout. Certain inputs have a particular function, so attach them properly.
- The `POTn_GND` and `POTn_VCC` terminals of each potentiometer are interchangeable. If the clutch (or axis) goes to 100% when idle, swap those terminals.
- Push buttons:
  - There are three `ALL_SW_COM` pins. They are intended for the left, center and right sides of the steering wheel, but you may use any of them.
  - Wire `ALL_SW_COM` to just one terminal of each push button *in a chain*.
  - Wire the other terminal of each push button to one of the light-blue pins.
  - Bare bone rotary encoders: their built-in push button must be wired like any other push button, being `SW` and `SW COM` the involved terminals.
- In a battery-operated setup:
  - Solder the battery connector to the standalone wires with Dupond plugs in the other end.
  - `Battery(+)` is the positive pole of the battery.
  - `Battery(-)` is the negative pole of the battery.
  - Attach `Battery(+)` and `Battery(-)` properly. **Take care not to swap those terminals**.
  - Battery charge port:
    - Cut the USB cable near the Micro-USB/USB-C end, but leave enough length to reach the GX16 plug.
    - Make sure matching GX16 pins in both male and female connectors are soldered to the same wire (same color).
    - Red and black wires are mandatory. Others are optional.
- In an externally powered setup:
  - Solder the external connector to the standalone wires with Dupond plugs in the other end.
  - Leave `Battery(+)` unwired (obviously).
  - `EXTERNAL_5V` is the positive terminal of the external power source. Any DC source from +5V to +7V is suitable.
  - `EXTERNAL_GND` is the negative (or ground) terminal of the external power source.
  - Leave `EXTERNAL_3V3` unwired, unless you have a 3.3 volts externally regulated power source (very uncommon). In such a case, leave `EXTERNAL_5V` unwired.
  - You may use the USB plug as an external power source, instead. But, in such a case, leave `EXTERNAL_3V3`, `EXTERNAL_5V` and `EXTERNAL_GND` unwired.
- Rotary encoder #1 is mandatory.

## Firmware upload

At Arduino IDE, configure the board manager for "TinyPICO".

**You should calibrate your battery first**. See the [Battery calibration procedure](../../../../src/Firmware/BatteryTools/BatteryCalibration/README.md).

1. Plug the USB cable to the Devkit board and upload the [sketch](../../../../src/Firmware/Setup4/Setup4.ino) with Arduino IDE.
2. Open the serial monitor (Arduino IDE).
3. Reset.
4. Check there are no error messages.
