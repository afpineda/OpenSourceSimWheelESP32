## Circuit layout

Open the [circuit layout](./setup2.diy) using [DIY Layout Creator](https://github.com/bancika/diy-layout-creator).

![Setup #2 circuit layout](./setup2.png)

This layout includes the following subsystems (read for an in-depth explanation):

- [Power](../../subsystems/Power/Power_en.md) through an external power source.
- [Switches](../../subsystems/Switches/Switches_en.md) through a button matrix.
- [Relative rotary encoder](../../subsystems/RelativeRotaryEncoder/RelativeRotaryEncoder_en.md) barebone type.

Notes and build tips:

- Some components may look very small, not matching their actual size. This is not a mistake. They must be placed in vertical position, so they lie in a minimal surface of the perfboard. All resistors and diodes should fit in 1x4 holes when they lay in horizontal position.
- There is a lot of wiring, which is prone to human error. Check wiring and traces twice before soldering.
- Choose one and only one power source (USB, `EXTERNAL_5V0` or `EXTERNAL_3V3`). Your board could get damaged if using two power sources at the same time. `EXTERNAL_GND` must be used along with `EXTERNAL_5V0` or `EXTERNAL_3V3` (but not both).

### External wiring

- Rotary's built in push buttons are wired to the button matrix (terminals `SW` and `SW GND`) as any other push button.
- Each input has an assigned number in the circuit layout. Certain inputs have a particular function, so attach them properly.

## Firmware upload

1. Detatch the DevKit board from the circuit before continuing. 
2. Plug the USB cable to the Devkit board and upload the [sketch](../../../../src/Firmware/Setup2/Setup2.ino) with Arduino IDE.
3. Attach the DevKit board to the circuit. Keep the USB cable plugged in.
4. Open the serial monitor (Arduino IDE).
5. Reset.
6. Check there are no error messages.
