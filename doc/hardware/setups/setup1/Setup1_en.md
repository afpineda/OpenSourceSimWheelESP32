Other parts (quantity unknown):

Notes:

- **Optional funky switch**: ALPS [RKJXT1F42001](https://tech.alpsalpine.com/prod/e/html/multicontrol/switch/rkjxt/rkjxt1f42001.html). **Replaces** rotary encoder #4, D-PAD and push button #15.
- Ensure trim potentiometer is "vertically operated".
- Choose a suitable OLED as recommended at the [display subsystem](../../subsystems/Display/Display_en.md). If your OLED does not match the one listed before, minor software tweaks are required as explained in that subsystem.
- Choose a powerboost module as recommended at the [power subsystem](../../subsystems/Power/Power_en.md).
- If battery is not required, exclude the obvious parts: Powerboost module/shield, LiPo battery and push button for POWER ON.

## Circuit layout

Open the [circuit layout](./setup1.diy) using [DIY Layout Creator](https://github.com/bancika/diy-layout-creator).

![Setup #3 circuit layout](./setup1.png)

This layout includes the following subsystems (read for an in-depth explanation):

- [Power](../../subsystems/Power/Power_en.md) through a powerboost module/shield.
- [Power latch](../../subsystems/PowerLatch/PowerLatch_en.md).
- [Battery monitor](../../subsystems/BatteryMonitor/BatteryMonitor_en.md).
- [Switches](../../subsystems/Switches/Switches_en.md).
- [Relative rotary encoder](../../subsystems/RelativeRotaryEncoder/RelativeRotaryEncoder_en.md) KY-040 type.
- [Display](../../subsystems/Display/Display_en.md).

Notes and build tips:

- Your actual transistors may use a different pinout, so check first.
- Ensure you do not confuse PNP with NPN transistors.
- Some components may look very small, not matching their actual size. This is not a mistake. They must be placed in vertical position, so they lie in a minimal surface of the perfboard. All resistors and diodes should fit in 1x4 holes when they lay in horizontal position.
- There is a lot of wiring, which is prone to human error. Check wiring and traces twice before soldering. Note that switch #17 is attached to a single wire unlike the others (this is not a mistake).
- Never use `POWERBOOST_3V3` and `POWERBOOST_GND` along with `EXTERNAL_5V0` and `EXTERNAL_GND`. This will damage your board. Choose one pair.

### External wiring

Each input has an assigned number in the circuit layout. Certain inputs have a particular function, so attach them properly.

If a battery is not required:

- Leave `Battery(+)` and `POWER_LATCH` unattached.
- If the external power source does not provide 3.3V, leave `POWERBOOST_GND` and `POWERBOOST_3V3` unattached.
- If the external power source provides 5 to 12V, attach an USB cable or both `EXTERNAL_5V0` and `EXTERNAL_GND`. Look at the [power subsystem](../../subsystems/Power/Power_en.md) for requirements.

**Under no circumstances should you plug a powerboost module along with an external power source at the same time**. You could damage the DevKit board.

***Warning***

If rotary encoders numbered #1 or #2 are not required, their pin headers must be wired to `3V3`. This applies to `ROTARY1_CLK`, `ROTARY1_SW`, `ROTARY1_DT` and `ROTARY2_CLK`. Otherwise, you will get ghost inputs.

***Funky switch***

Funky switch (optional) is wired this way:

| Funky switch terminal |         Pin header          |
| :-------------------: | :-------------------------: |
|           A           |  top row pin of input #16   |
|           B           |  top row pin of input #18   |
|           C           |  top row pin of input #17   |
|           D           |  top row pin of input #19   |
|         Push          |  top row pin of input #15   |
|          com          | bottom row pin of input #15 |
|       Encoder A       |        Rotary #4 CLK        |
|       Encoder B       |        Rotary #4 DT         |
|      Encoder com      |        Rotary #4 GND        |

## Firmware upload

You may want to calibrate your battery first. See the [Battery calibration procedure](../../../../src/Firmware/BatteryTools/BatteryCalibration/README_en.md).

1. Detach the DevKit board from the circuit before continuing. 
2. Plug the USB cable to the Devkit board and upload the [sketch](../../../../src/Firmware/Setup1/Setup1.ino) with Arduino IDE.
3. Attach the DevKit board to the circuit. Keep the USB cable plugged in.
4. Open the serial monitor (Arduino IDE).
5. Reset.
6. Check there are no error messages.
