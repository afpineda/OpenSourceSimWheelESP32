# Ready to deploy design #9

Read this document from start to end before building anything. Ensure you understand everything.

**This setup has not been tested at the system level**. If you try, please, let me know.

## Hardware features

- Bluetooth Low Energy.
- Externally powered through USB cable or quick-release.
- Analog clutch paddles (potentiometers).
- Up to 7 relative rotary encoders (*without* push button). Up to 8 if no funky switch is in place.
- Optional funky switch or DPAD (but not both).
- Shift paddles (x2).
- "ALT" buttons (x2).
- Up to 28 additional push buttons.

## Button mapping

- *Bite point calibration*: rotary #1 clockwise and counter-clockwise (while holding one and only one clutch paddle).
- *Next clutch function*: `START` and `Left shift paddle`.
- *ALT buttons mode*: `START` and `Right shift paddle`.
- *Recalibrate clutch paddles*: `Left shift paddle`, `Right shift paddle` and `START`.

You may use the [companion app](https://github.com/afpineda/SimWheelESP32Config) as an alternative to those button combinations.

## Circuit layout

We are reusing the [GPIO expanders example](../../subsystems/Switches/MCP23017Switches.diy) as a *satellite circuit*.

![Satellite circuit](./../../subsystems/Switches/MCP23017Switches.png)

Open the [wiring layout](./Setup9.diy) using [DIY Layout Creator](https://github.com/bancika/diy-layout-creator).

![Setup #9 wiring layout](./Setup9.png)

This design includes the following subsystems (read for an in-depth explanation):

- [Power](../../subsystems/Power/Power_en.md) through a external power source.
- [Switches](../../subsystems/Switches/Switches_en.md) by the means of GPIO expanders and directly-attached.
- [Relative rotary encoder](../../subsystems/RelativeRotaryEncoder/RelativeRotaryEncoder_en.md) bare bone type.
- [Analog clutch paddles](../../subsystems/AnalogClutchPaddles/AnalogClutchPaddles_en.md).

Notes and build tips:

- We are using 90-degree blended pin headers in order to make it easier to fit the electronics into the wheel's housing.
  You may replace them with directly-soldered wires. You have to solder the double-row pin headers to the DevKit board yourself.
- Check wiring and traces twice before soldering.
- You may use bare-bone rotary encoders with push buttons, too. In such a case, wire `SW` and `SW GND` terminals as switches.
- A funky switch or DPAD is optional. If you choose not to wire any of them, it's recommended to attach a switch to `Push`.
- You may use an additional regular rotary encoder instead of a funky switch (adding up to 8 rotary encoders).
  In such a case, the `A` terminal is equivalent to `ENCODER_A`, and the `B` terminal is equivalent to `ENCODER_B`.
  However, you must **modify the sketch** ([Setup9.ino](../../../../src/Firmware/Setup9/Setup9.ino))
  in this way. Locate the following text line:

  ```c++
  #define USE_FUNKY true
  ```

  and replace with the following text line:

  ```c++
  #define USE_FUNKY false
  ```

- Cover the back of the satellite circuit and the DevKit board with cardboard and isolation tape. This prevents unnoticed short-circuits.

### External wiring

- Certain inputs have a particular function as shown in the following table, so **attach them properly**.

  | Location          | Tag                          | Particular function       |
  | ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
  | DevKit            | Push                         | "A" button in Windows     |
  | DevKit            | A (Up)                       | Navigation                |
  | DevKit            | B (Left)                     | Navigation                |
  | DevKit            | C (Down)                     | Navigation                |
  | DevKit            | D (Right)                    | Navigation                |
  | Satellite circuit | Address = 7, switch index 0  | Left SHIFT paddle         |
  | Satellite circuit | Address = 7, switch index 1  | Right SHIFT paddle        |
  | Satellite circuit | Address = 7, switch index 15 | "ALT" button              |
  | Satellite circuit | Address = 7, switch index 14 | "ALT" button              |
  | Satellite circuit | Address = 0, switch index 15 | "Start" button in Windows |
  | Satellite circuit | Address = 0, switch index 14 | "Back" button in Windows  |
  | Satellite circuit | Address = 0, switch index 13 | "B" button in Windows     |
  | Satellite circuit | Address = 0, switch index 12 | "X" button in Windows     |
  | Satellite circuit | Address = 0, switch index 11 | "Y" button in Windows     |

- The `GND` and `3V3` terminals of each potentiometer are interchangeable. If the clutch (or axis) goes to 100% when idle, swap those terminals.
  They are attached to the satellite circuit (same tags).
- `EXT_5V` is the positive pole of your power source.`EXT_GND` is the negative pole of your power source.
  Attach them properly. **Take care not to swap those terminals**.
  If you have a *Simagic QR*, `EXT_GND` is the yellow wire and `EXT_5V` is the green one.
- Alternatively, you may use a USB cable as the power source (attached to the USB header).
  However, **under no circumstances** should you power the board using the USB header and the `EXT_` terminals simultaneously.
- The actual wiring of your (optional) funky switch **may not match** the one shown here. Look for a data sheet.
- **Misleading tags** have been reported at some ALPS funky switches. Be warned.
  Those show erroneously swapped `COM` and `PUSH` tags, at least, in their data sheet. Check first. If you come into one of them, swap those terminals.
- The `COM` terminals of all rotary encoders (and the `ENCODER_COM` terminal of the funky switch) must be attached to `GND` at the satellite circuit.
- Wire one terminal of each switch together *in a chain* to a single `GND` pin (as shown in the diagram above).
  If there are not enough `GND` pins in the satellite circuit, use this trick.

## Firmware upload

At Arduino IDE, configure the board manager for **"LOLIN S3 Mini (esp32)"**.
Configure "Core Debug Level" to "Error".

1. Plug the USB cable to the Devkit board and upload the [sketch](../../../../src/Firmware/Setup9/Setup9.ino) with Arduino IDE.
2. Open the serial monitor (Arduino IDE).
3. Reset.
4. Check there are no error messages.
