## Contributing

- Ways to contribute:
  
  - Report bugs.
  - Contribute with an open design for a steering wheel housing.
  - Contribute a ready-to-deploy circuit layout for other ESP32-based boards.
  - Share your experience and contribute with a tutorial.

- Pull request policy (contributing with new code):
  
  - Code for custom projects will be rejected. Provide code that everyone can benefit from.
  - All relevant quality controls must be updated along with the new code.
  - You must run all relevant quality controls.
  - Provide an explicit declaration that all relevant quality controls failed (so, the software passed the Q controls).
  - You must contribute to the firmware documentation as you do with code.
